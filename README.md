### Project Idea: AI-Driven Threat Intelligence and Incident Response System ###

● Description: Create an agent that analyzes security logs, identifies potential threats,
and provides real-time incident response recommendations based on previous
incidents.
● Key Features:
o LLM Fine-Tuning on Security Logs: Fine-tune an LLM on security logs,
threat intelligence reports, and vulnerability databases.
o RAGs for Threat Intelligence Retrieval: Use RAGs to fetch the latest threat
reports, attack patterns, and defense strategies.
o Agent for Incident Response: Automate threat detection and suggest
immediate actions based on the severity of incidents.
● Steps:
o Collect datasets of security logs, attack patterns, and incident response
strategies.
o Fine-tune the LLM to recognize and classify cybersecurity threats and
anomalies.
o Implement RAGs to retrieve the latest threat intelligence and response
strategies.
o Build an agent that automates threat detection and provides real-time
recommendations.
o Evaluate the system’s ability to detect and respond to real-world cyber threats
